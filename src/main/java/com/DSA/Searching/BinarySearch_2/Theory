For binary search, you need a sorted array.
You start at the middle index and compare the element that you are searching for with the element at the middle index.
If the element at this index does not match the element that you are searching for,
then you check whether it is greater or lesser than the element at the index.
If it is greater than the element at the middle index, then you discard everything to the left and move to the right.
Then you find the middle of this array, which is to the right,
compare the required element with its middle and continue doing this until you find the required element.
