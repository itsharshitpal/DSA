    Quick Sort

    Description
        Write a program in Java that takes an array of strings as input and returns the sorted array. Assume that the sorting needs to be done based on the size of each string. So, a string with fewer characters should come before another string with more number of characters. Use the quicksort algorithm for the program.

    Sample Input - 1:
        7
        Christene
        Tomas
        Marline
        Marcelluss
        Michelle
        Quiana
        Keny

    Sample Output - 1:
        Keny
        Tomas
        Quiana
        Marline
        Michelle
        Christene
        Marcelluss

    So, the first input is the number of elements in the array. In this case, the number of elements is 7. Next 7 inputs are the elements inside the array. As you can see in the output, the names are sorted as per their length. The name with fewer characters comes before the names with more characters.

    Sample Input - 1:
        3
        Cat
        Tree
        Bag

    Sample Output - 2:
        Cat
        Bag
        Tree

    So, the first input is the number of elements in the array. In this case, the number of elements is 3. Next 3 inputs are the elements inside the array. As you can see in the output, the names are sorted as per their length.

    Please note that Quick Sort is an unstable sorting algorithm. So, the words with same number of characters may come in a different sequence for different people depending upon the factors outside our control.
