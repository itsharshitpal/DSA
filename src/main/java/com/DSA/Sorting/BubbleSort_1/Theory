                                            ** How the Bubble sort algorithm works. **

We start with the first two numbers in each iteration and perform a comparison between them.
When the numbers are not in order, we swap them. We repeat the same steps for the second and third numbers,
and so on. At the end of the first iteration, the largest number is pushed to the end of the array;
at the end of the second iteration, the second largest number is pushed to the second last position,and so on



                                            ** Array Sorting Using Bubble Sort **


Now, We understand how the bubble sort works. Now, let's see its practical implementation by sorting the given array.

Let's assume you are having an array of 5 elements
[18,3,17,19,1]

Code Snippet of Bubble Sort
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j < (numbers.length - i); j++) {
        if (numbers[j - 1] > numbers[j]) {
            //swap elements
            swap(j - 1, j, numbers);
        }
    }
}

Now, let's see what happens to our array when it went through the Bubble Sort Algorithm
After first pass :
3 18 17 19 1
3 17 18 19 1
3 17 18 19 1
3 17 18 1 19

After second pass:
3 17 18 1 19
3 17 18 1 19
3 17 1 18 19

After third pass:
3 17 1 18 19
3 1 17 18 19

After fourth pass:
1 3 17 18 19

So, you can see our unsorted array [18,3,17,19,1] becomes sorted array [1,3,17,18,19] after going through the Bubble Sort Algorithm.
